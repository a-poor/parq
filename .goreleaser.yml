    summary: A CLI for exploring parquet files.
    description: parq is a CLI for working with parquet files. It allows you to view a file's schema, print it a a table (the full data, head, tail, and random), and convert to/from parquet files.

    # A guardrail to prevent you from releasing a snap to all your users before
    # it is ready.
    # `devel` will let you release only to the `edge` and `beta` channels in the
    # store. `stable` will let you release also to the `candidate` and `stable`
    # channels.
    grade: stable

    # Snaps can be setup to follow three different confinement policies:
    # `strict`, `devmode` and `classic`. A strict confinement where the snap
    # can only read and write in its own namespace is recommended. Extra
    # permissions for strict snaps can be declared as `plugs` for the app, which
    # are explained later. More info about confinement here:
    # https://snapcraft.io/docs/reference/confinement
